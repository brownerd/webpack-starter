# Webpack Starter

This is based off of:
- [Black Triangle](https://github.com/jamesknelson/webpack-black-triangle) - [Unicorn Standard](http://unicornstandard.com/packages/boilerplate.html) and a few EggHead video tutorials. Still trying to grok Webpack setup.
- [Webpack Made Simple: Building ES6 & LESS with autorefresh](http://jamesknelson.com/webpack-made-simple-build-es6-less-with-autorefresh-in-26-lines/)

## Stack
- Babel
- Stylus
- PostCSS
    - Autoprefixer
    - Pixrem
    - PseudoElements

## Issues
I'm still new to this so I probably have some weird settings in here. But I have a point of reference now.
